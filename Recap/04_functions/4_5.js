// Create a function named calcDistance which takes the coordinates of two different points A and B in a 2D space. 
// That function must return the distance between those two points.

// Create a program to use that function.

// Note: You probably need to make some search on Google to learn the mathematical formula to do that. 
// You will also probably need to search for useful functions in JavaScript to help you making complex mathematical formulas...
