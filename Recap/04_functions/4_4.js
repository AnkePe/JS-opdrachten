// Create a function named average(arr) that takes an array of numbers as argument and returns the average.

// Create a function named min(arr) that takes an array of numbers as argument and returns the minimum element.

// Create a function named max(arr) that takes an array of numbers as argument and returns the maximum element.

// Create a program that asks a number to the user then generate that same amount of 
// random numbers but also displays their average, min and max. 
// To do so, use the three functions you just created as well as the multiRand(n) function created in Exercise 3.
